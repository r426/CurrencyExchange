# Currency_Exchange_6_Retrofit_Coroutines

Further development of Currency Exchange Android app.

Adding Retrofit & coroutines to the MVVM architecture (LiveData, dataBinding & ViewModel).

Huge thanks to [Miriana Itani](https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Miriana/Itani#.XuIPKOgNmd5.linkedin), who explained Retrofit & coroutines to me and kindly shared her code as an example.
